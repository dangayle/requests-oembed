# Requests oEmbed

A library to embed html objects via oEmbed, using the [Requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) lib.

## Usage

```python
from requests_oembed import get_embed_html
print get_embed_html('https://twitter.com/dangayle/status/284836686171627521')
```

## Caveats

It's likely buggy since I coded it from scratch to see if I could, but it works for me.
